**Number of images:** 675.

**Number of annotations:** 1,262.

**Number of classes:** 4, including: open-hole (359), Safety-barrier (338), Safety-bollard (318), Safety-cone (247).

**Dataset description:** This dataset contains images captured at construction sites to serve the purpose of construction safety - Open hole / unsafe excavation detection model. The model will be deployed to our Jetson-based edge inference systems for job sites allowing us to monitor and report on unsafe conditions surrounding excavation and earth moving. This model should run on a single-board computer; we will likely combine functionality with the PPE model to determine if somebody is wearing a harness near an unsafe excavation.
