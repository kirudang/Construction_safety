\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
This dataset contains images captured at construction sites to serve for the purpose of construction safety - Open hole / unsafe excavation detection model. The model will be deployed to our Jetson-based edge inference systems for job sites allowing us to monitor and report on unsafe conditions surrounding excavation and earth moving. This model should run on a single-board computer; we will likely combine functionality with the PPE model to determine if somebody is wearing a harness near an unsafe excavation.}
