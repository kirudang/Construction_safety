# Construction Safety - Object detection 

## Use case:
**Open Hole / Unsafe Excavation** is a model to detect unsafe holes on construction sites. This model combined with the (Personal Protective Equipment) PPE detection model will be deployed to our Jetson-based edge inference systems for job sites allowing us to monitor and report on unsafe conditions surrounding the excavation.

## Workflow and tech stack:
To train the model, the author has embraced an Iterative Training Process using Roboflow for Data Preparation and Deployment, while Google Colab is used for model custom training.
